# Terrain-Identification-from-Time-Series-Data
The project focuses on implementing Deep Learning Models to identify multiple terrains(grass, concrete, floor) and directions(walking straight, upstairs, or downstairs) from time-series data captured with help of an accelerometer and gyrosensor. • Performed Data preprocessing on time-series data to match the frequency of the data from multiple sensors(10hz frequency) and data labels(40hz frequency) • Performed Exploratory data analysis to identify multiple data trends within the data which helped in implementing new feature extractions on those data labels. • Implemented various Deep Learning - CNN, LSTM, BI-LSTM models • Bi-LSTM model trained with new additional features was able to achieve 91% accuracy over unseen test data  Tech Stack: Python, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, RNN, Keras
